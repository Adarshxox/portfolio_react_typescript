        <p>
          I am a Python Full Stack Developer specializing in building scalable web applications from the ground up. I hold a <strong>Master of Computer Applications</strong> from Bangalore University, where I gained a strong foundation in Data Structures, Algorithms, and Operating Systems.

        <p>
          I work with a modern tech stack including Python and Django for backend development, and JavaScript with React.js for creating dynamic, responsive frontends. I am proficient in designing and implementing RESTful APIs using the <strong>Django REST Framework (DRF)</strong>, ensuring smooth communication between client and server. Additionally, I have experience containerizing applications with <strong>Docker</strong> for consistent development and deployment environments.

          During my internship at Luminar Technolab, I refactored a legacy forum using Django and React, implemented a RESTful API with DRF, and integrated <strong>Django Channels</strong> for real-time updates. At Caadmax Edtech PVT LTD, I contributed as part of an Agile team, developing responsive web applications with Java and React.js, participating in daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and code reviews.
